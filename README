PHP Database class for MySQL

This database is created and maintined for use in my personal and professional projects.

It provides a security layer on top of MySQL by forcing the programmer to declare data typed during the insert and select queries, which are then checked and fail if they look fishy.

The license provided in code must be kept as is. The rest is up for modification. If you do modify, please use github and request a pull so we can all benefit.
